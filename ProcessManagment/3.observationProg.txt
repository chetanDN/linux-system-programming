Observation program:
main()
{
	printf("before %d and %d\n",getpid(),getppid());
	fork();
	printf("1: %d and %d\n”,getpid(),getppid());
	fork();
	printf("2: %d and %d\n”,getpid( ),getppid());
	fork();
	printf("3: %d and %d\n”,getpid(),getppid());
}

Observe the o/p of this above programme and draw its process generation diagram with
its instruction ,processed, parent process Id of the new process which is generated and
compare with output.


o/p -> there will be in total 8 process
